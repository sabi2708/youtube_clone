This YouTube clone project is built using HTML, CSS, and Django, a Python web framework. It replicates the core features of YouTube, including video uploads, playback, user authentication, and a dynamic video feed. 
The frontend is styled with CSS to provide a user-friendly interface, while Django handles backend logic, including database management, user sessions, and video processing. The project demonstrates how to integrate 
frontend and backend technologies to create a fully functional web application. Ultimate goals of this project include providing a platform for video content and allowing users to interact with videos 
in a seamless environment.
